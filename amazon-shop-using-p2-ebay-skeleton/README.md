## Phase Two Assessment

This assessment is a way to gain insight into your current abilities in the concepts taught during Phase Two. This assessment will provide you insight into your strengths and areas where you might need improvement. *Success* on this assessment means that you *gain self awareness* and *expose your ignorance* to instructors who want to help you get better. These are uncomfortable, but essential to learning.

In this assessment, you are asked to complete three challenges. The first two challenges should take about an hour an half to complete. The final challenge may take you the rest of core hours to complete. It is recommend to complete parts 1 and 2 first and then complete as many releases as you can in the remaining challenge.

Do not build more complexity than is explicitly required.

- [Part 1 - JavaScript Objects](part-1/)
- [Part 2 - AJAX](part-2/)
- [Part 3 - Build a CRUD App](part-3/)
